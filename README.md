# Emb-Rust
Embedded Rust example for STM32F4-Discovery board.

The [Rust Discovery book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/index.html) is an excellent introduction to embedded Rust.
The book uses the slighty different STM32**F3**-Discovery board, whereas this project uses the STM32**F4**-Discovery board.

## Setup

Using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 

1. Install Rust using [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), update if required
1. Install the multi-architecture debugger gdb and open On-Chip debugger packages using:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$ sudo apt-get install gdb-multiarch openocd`

3. Set udev rules for USB to enable access without root privilege
* Create the file `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-openocd.rules`

* Add the following lines to the file 
``` 
# STM32F4 - ST-Link/V2 
ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="3748", MODE:="0666" 
```

* Reload the rules with 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`

## Verify the board
Connect the discovery board ST-Link (USB mini B) port to the computer USB port and type:

```
$ lsusb | grep -i stm
Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0483:3748 STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2
```

Note that the Bus and Device numbers may differ, but the ID should be the same if you have a STM32F4-Discovery board.


### Verify the permissions
```
$ ls -l /dev/bus/usb/001/006
crw-rw-rw-+ 1 root plugdev 189, 5 Aug 13 14:48 /dev/bus/usb/001/006
```
As above the permissions should be `crw-rw-rw-`


# Build the application
Run the command:

`$ cargo build`

Note that this uses the `.cargo\config` file to set the target to `thumbv7em-none-eabi` for the Cortex-M4 processor on the STM32F4-discovery board.

Alternatively run the command:

`cargo build --target thumbv7em-none-eabi`

This build uses the memory map for the STM32F4-Discovery board recorded in the file `memory.x`.

# Flash the application

First open the OCD connection.

## Open OCD connection
Run the command:

`$ openocd -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg`


This should produce the following output:

```

```

Also, one of the red LEDs, the one closest to the USB port, should start oscillating between red light and green light.

Use control-c to quit the program.

### Connect GDB
With OCD running in another terminal run the following command:

`$ gdb-multiarch -q target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/debug/emb-rust`

You should see:
```
Registered pretty printers for UE4 classes
Reading symbols from target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/debug/emb-rust...
(gdb) 
```
Connect to OCD
```
(gdb) target remote :3333
Remote debugging using :3333
0x00000000 in ?? ()
(gdb)
```

Load the application
```
(gdb) load
Loading section .vector_table, size 0x1a8 lma 0x8000000
Loading section .text, size 0x4230 lma 0x80001a8
Loading section .rodata, size 0xa4c lma 0x80043e0
Start address 0x080041fe, load size 20004

(gdb) 
```

## Debug Application

```
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80002d8: file src/main.rs, line 18.
(gdb) continue
Continuing.
Note: automatically using hardware breakpoints for read-only addresses.

Breakpoint 1, main () at src/main.rs:18
18      #[entry]
(gdb) 
```

You can use standard GDB commands at this point.

## Running the Application
Note that you can disconnect the board from the computer and attach it to a power source and the application will automatically be copied from flash and start running.
